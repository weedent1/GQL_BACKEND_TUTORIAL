  // You can uncomment the code below but it isnt necessary for the code to run, graphql automaically does the following for us 
  // Uncommenting the code will not cause an error it will simply work the same as this is what gql does under the hood

On the first level, it invokes the feed resolver and returns the entire data stored in links. For the second execution level, the GraphQL server is smart enough to invoke the resolvers of the Link type (because thanks to the schema, it knows that feed returns a list of Link elements) for each element inside the list that was returned on the previous resolver level. Therefore, in all of the three Link resolvers, the incoming parent object is the element inside the links list.

Note: To learn more about this, check out this article.

In any case, because the implementation of the Link resolvers is trivial, you can actually omit them and the server will work in the same way as it did before ðŸ‘Œ We just wanted you to understand whatâ€™s happening under the hood ðŸš—
